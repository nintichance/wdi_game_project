##### About Me & This Project
I am a Web Development Immersive student at General Assembly in Atlanta, Ga. I have been coding since October and I have been loving every second of it. This game is written with jQuery, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

#### What I've learned...
This project taught me that not only did I learn a lot of syntax and concept in the past two weeks, but that I also know how to practically apply what I've learned. I was thrilled to discover this, although I know I have a lot to go along the way. I am excited to learn more skills. This week specifically taught me where I stand with:
* HTML & CSS
* DOM manipulation
* Version control (GIT + GIT Hub)
* jQuery and JavaScript

#### Version Two?
Everyone asks when they love a popular game if a second version will come out? Well, in version two, we will have a better question prompt in the form of a modul, randomized categories, and a new slick design! Get ready to play your friends and family because we will also introduce multi-player. Finally, we will soon offer a version for phones!
